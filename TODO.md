# TODO (planned, not started)

## 1. LINE Login — sign in with LINE *or* phone number
- [ ] Add "Login with LINE" next to the existing phone + password login (keep both).
- [ ] Backend: OAuth flow (`/auth/line/start` → LINE → `/auth/line/callback`), verify the ID token, find/create the user by `users.line_user_id` (column already exists), then issue our normal JWT.
- [ ] LINE doesn't provide a phone number → ask new LINE users for their phone once (needed for contact and walk-in matching). Let existing phone users link their LINE account.
- Cost: LINE Login is free. Estimate: ~1–2 days.

## 2. LINE OA notifications
- [ ] Replace the simulated LINE messages (`line_messages` in localStorage) with real Messaging API push messages: booking created (with QR/amount), slip approved, slip rejected (with reason), booking expired, day-before reminder.
- [ ] On LINE login, offer "add the OA as friend" (customers must be friends to receive pushes).
- [ ] Send from the backend after the DB transaction commits; a failed push must never fail the booking.
- Cost (Thailand, check current prices): Free plan = 300 push messages/month (~150 bookings at ~2 messages each); Basic ฿1,280/month + VAT = 15,000 messages. Replies to customer chats are free. Estimate: ~1–2 days on top of item 1.
- Optional later: LIFF (open the booking site inside the LINE app with automatic login), ~1 day.

### Prerequisites (owner to prepare)
- [ ] LINE Business ID → create the LINE Official Account.
- [ ] LINE Developers Console: **one Provider** containing both a **LINE Login channel** and a **Messaging API channel** (same provider, or the user IDs won't match).
- [ ] Channel secrets / access tokens go in `golang-backend/.env` only, never in the repo or chat.
- [ ] A public HTTPS address (deployed app) for the login callback and webhook; a temporary tunnel is fine for testing.

## 3. Mobile-friendly UI
- [ ] Make the customer pages work well on phones (most customers will book from LINE / mobile): booking grid (currently a wide table), checkout + QR step, booking history, login/register.
- [ ] Staff POS usable on a tablet.
- [ ] Check at 375px width (iPhone SE) and 390–430px; no sideways scrolling, buttons big enough to tap.

## 4. Test the features
- [ ] Add items 1–3 to `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` and run through the whole checklist on real phones (iOS + Android, inside the LINE app and in a normal browser).
- [ ] Scan the PromptPay QR with at least two Thai banking apps.
